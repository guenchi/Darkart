## What is the Darkart

Darkart implements a set of interfaces to other language libraries that can be used to easily bind other languages' libraries to Scheme.

Thanks to Chez Scheme's efficient binary interface, Darkart access to libraries in other languages is very efficient and may even be faster than native languages. For example, [Darkart-based Scheme binding of NumPy](https://github.com/guenchi/NumPy) is faster than the Python version.

Darkart solves the  dilemmas of libraries of lisp community.
